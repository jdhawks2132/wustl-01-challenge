### User Story

- GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
  - WHEN I view the source code
    - THEN I find semantic HTML elements
  - WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
    - THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
  - WHEN I view the image elements
    - THEN I find accessible alt attributes
  - WHEN I view the heading attributes
    - THEN they fall in sequential order
  - WHEN I view the title element
    - THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
